## Running the program

### VSCode
If you are using VSCode with the Metals extension, you should be able to simply run the project using the integrated VSCode debugger. The setup is located in the .vscode/launch.json file.

### CLI
Open a terminal in the project directory. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
